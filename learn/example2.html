                    SAN FRANCISCO: Russian government-supported organizations are playing a small but increasing role
                    amplifying conspiracy theories promoted by QAnon, raising concerns of interference in the November
                    US election.

                    Academics who study QAnon said there were no signs Russia had a hand in the early days of the
                    movement, which launched in 2017 with anonymous web postings amplified by YouTube videos.

                    But as QAnon gained adherents and took on new topics, with President Donald Trump as the constant
                    hero waging a misunderstood battle, social media accounts controlled by a key Kremlin ally joined
                    in.
